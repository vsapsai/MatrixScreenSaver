# MatrixScreenSaver
MatrixScreenSaver is a Mac OS X screen saver created with Core Animation.  It has performance problems, so it is more an example how not to make screen savers.

Obviously, the idea for screen saver is not mine, it is taken from the movie [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/).  Also I've used as the reference [Matrix Screen Saver by Kelly Software](http://www.kellysoftware.com/ssaver/matrix_ks.asp) and [The Matrix in Sass](http://codepen.io/jlong/pen/wciCv) by [John W. Long](https://twitter.com/johnwlong).
